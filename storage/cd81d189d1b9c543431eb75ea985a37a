{"key":"teacher: The Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a web3 concept describing a group, company or collective that are bound by rules and regulations coded into a blockchain. For example, in a DAO-based shop, the price of all of the items, as well as details on who would get pay-outs from the business, would be held on a blockchain. Shareholders in the DAO would be able to vote to change prices or who gets the money.","value":"A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a type of organisation that is autonomously managed by a set of rules, regulations, and protocols encoded into a blockchain. It is a form of distributed governance, where decisions are made by a consensus of stakeholders, instead of a centralised authority. In a DAO, the rules and regulations are programmed into a smart contract, and all stakeholders can view, monitor, and vote on changes to the DAO's rules and regulations. This ensures that all stakeholders have equal access to the decision-making process, and that any changes are made in a transparent and fair manner.","ttl":1679226438854}
