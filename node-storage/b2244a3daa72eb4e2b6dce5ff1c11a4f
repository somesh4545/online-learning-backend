For example, if someone wanted to sell something on the DAO network, they could do so by creating a DAO-based shop and listing items for sale. The items in the shop would be held on a blockchain, and shareholders could vote on the prices of the items. If the prices were to change, the items in the shop would be updated automatically.","ttl":1679234882607}
