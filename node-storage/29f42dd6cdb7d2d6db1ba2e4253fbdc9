It is an autonomous entity that operates without any kind of traditional management structure. Instead, it is maintained and governed by a set of rules that are programmed into the blockchain, allowing for a self-sustaining and transparent system. The DAO allows for shareholders to vote on changes to the organization, such as changing the prices of items, deciding who receives payouts from the business, and making other decisions that would normally be controlled by a central entity.","ttl":1679235040617}
