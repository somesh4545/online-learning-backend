{"key":"teacher: The Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a web3 concept describing a group, company or collective that are bound by rules and regulations coded into a blockchain. For example, in a DAO-based shop, the price of all of the items, as well as details on who would get pay-outs from the business, would be held on a blockchain. Shareholders in the DAO would be able to vote to change prices or who gets the money.","value":"A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a type of organisation that is run by autonomous software on the blockchain. This means that it is not controlled by any central authority, but instead runs on its own. Its rules and regulations are encoded into the blockchain, which means that they are immutable and can not be changed. A DAO can be used to create a variety of collective organisations, such as a company, a shop, or a shared resource. The rules and regulations of the DAO are enforced through smart contracts, which are pieces of code that execute when certain conditions are met. For example, a DAO-based shop might have a smart contract that sets the price of all of the items, as well as details on who would get pay-outs from the business. Shareholders in the DAO would be able to vote to change prices or who gets the money, by using the blockchain voting system.","ttl":1679226917562}
